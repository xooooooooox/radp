/**
 * Constants for MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) keys used in logging. This utility class
 * defines standard key names for storing contextual information in the logging MDC, which
 * allows for enriched log entries with application, request, and method execution
 * details.
 *
 * <p>
 * MDC is a feature provided by logging frameworks like SLF4J and Log4j that allows
 * storing diagnostic context data by thread. This data can then be included in log
 * messages to provide additional context for troubleshooting and monitoring.
 *
 * <p>
 * The constants defined in this class are used by various logging components in the
 * framework, including:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bootstrap logging for application startup information</li>
 * <li>Access logging for HTTP request details</li>
 * <li>Method execution logging for performance monitoring</li>
 * </ul>
